 _why do you think 90% of machines get technically faulty?_

I dislike low productivity of a machines, it slows my momentum to work harder, what about you? sometimes it's really hard to configure or sort out the problem.Having potential breakdown in machines sometimes is disheartening.Yeah, i faced same issue sometime ago, it was not funny at all.
Though my payback is to find the nearest technician to get the issue resolved (due to some lack of communication) between the machines.
But, today in this post i will share with you the common communication system between hardware and software.

_Now let keep the ball rolling_ -

## What is Communication System
Communication Sytem are composed of hardware or software components that work together to enable the transmission of information from one end of the system to another.
Communication between hardware and software is typically accomplished using the following:
> - Aplication Program Interface(APIs) APIs are a set of instructions, functions, and protocols that allow communication between two systems. Examples of APIs include Printer API, Bluetooth API, Global Positioning System(GPS) API.

> - Communication protocols are a set of rules that govern how data is exchanged between two systems. Examples of communication protocols include UDP (User Datagram Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

_How does communication system works?_
A communication sytem works by transmitting and receiving signals between two or more devices.This system involves the combination of Hardware and Software components. From our explanation earlier, Communication systems, majorly, comprises of the hardware and software components.

### What are Hardware and Software Systems?

Hardware and Software systems are systems that facilitates the excahange of data and information between hardware components and software programs.
>  Note: Does hardware and software plays thesame role. No, they don't. Hardware is the physical components of a computer, such as the processor, the motherboard, the hard drive, the RAM, and other components, while software is a set of instructions that tells the hardware how to perform tasks. Hardware is responsible for actually performing the tasks, while software tells the hardware what tasks to perform.

#### Principles of communication system between (Hardware and Software)


1. Consistent Interface: The interface between hardware and software should be consistent and easy to use. It should be designed in a way that allows for quick and efficient communication.

2. Standard Protocols: A standard protocol should be used for communication between hardware and software components. This helps to ensure that information is exchanged in a consistent and reliable manner.

3. Error Checking: Error checking should be implemented to detect any errors that may occur during communication between hardware and software.

4. Data Encryption: Data encryption should be used to protect the data being exchanged between hardware and software.

5. Security Measures: Security measures should be taken to ensure that unauthorized access to the software or hardware is not possible.

6. Documentation: Documentation should be provided to help users understand the system and how to use it. This will ensure that users are able to take full advantage of the hardware and software communication system.
